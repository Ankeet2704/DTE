Ans: 1) Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport.
     2) Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and          (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.
