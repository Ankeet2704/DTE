4. What is <input type="hidden"  />  ? Why do we use?
Ans: The <input type="hidden"> defines a hidden input field. A hidden field lets web developers include data that cannot be seen or modified by users when a form is submitted. A hidden field often stores what database record that needs to be updated when the form is submitted. Hidden fields are used to pass information about the current page to the server. For example, if a user fills out an enquiry form, we may want to obtain their IP address using a snippet of PHP. We may also want to grab the URL of the referring page. You can see this in action in our code sample; the form captures the information, but does not display it. Hidden fields allow us to send all kinds of information along with a form message, without the user having to be involved in the process. Hidden fields can also be used to pass information back to scripts. This may include security tokens, or the name of the relevant row in the database. The user does not need to see this data, but it is passed back to the server on submission so that scripts function correctly behind the scenes.
