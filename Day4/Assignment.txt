1. What is differences between <head> and  <header> tags?
Ans: The head tag is used for holding Meta information, title, links, etc. and is not displayed on the page. 
     The header tag is used within the body of the website and can be used multiple times if required, e.g. to determine the top of an article.

2. How to allow only numbers in textbox?
Ans: 1. Using <input type="number"> - The standard solution to restrict a user to enter only numeric values is to use <input> elements of type number. It has           built-in validation to reject non-numerical values. For example:
        <label for="salary">Enter your salary:</label>
        <input type="number" id="salary" name="salary">

     2. Using pattern attribute - Alternatively, you can use the pattern attribute to specify a regular expression that should match the provided input. 
        If the values contain non-digit characters, the element matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-classes. For example:
        <label for="salary">Enter your salary:</label>
        <input type="text" id="salary" name="salary" pattern="[0-9]+">

     3. Using oninput event - Another solution is to use the oninput property to processes input events on the <input> elements. 
        To restrict the user to enter only numeric values, you can do like:
        <label for="salary">Enter your salary:</label>
        <input type="text" id="salary" name="salary"
        oninput="this.value = this.value.replace(/[^0-9.]/g, '').replace(/(\..*)\./g, '$1');" />
        
  4.  What is cookies in web applications? Why do we use?
  Ans: Cookies are small pieces of information websites store on your computer. Cookies only contain bits of text, not anything else. The text can be a user ID,        session ID, or any other text. For example, web pages can be configurable – a web page could have a Hide link that hides a certain element on the page.          The page can save this setting on your computer with a cookie. When you load the page in the future, the page can examine the cookie and automatically          hide the element. If you clear your cookies, you’ll be logged out of all websites and websites won’t remember any settings you’ve changed on them.
