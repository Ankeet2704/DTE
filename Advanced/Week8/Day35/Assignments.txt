2.  What are keys in React JS? How involve keys in array processing in React?
Ans: Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. 
     Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:
     
     const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
      <li key={number.toString()}>
      {number}
      </li>
     );
     
     The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. 
     Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys
