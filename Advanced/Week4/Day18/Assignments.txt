1. What is BOM? Difference between DOM and BOM?
Ans: BOM is a Browser Object Model, which is a window object supported by all browsers representing a browser window consisting of navigator, history, screen,        location and document objects which are children of windows. BOM can function to check an event from windows with window.addEventListener and can perform        manipulation using window.innerHeight and window.innerWidth.

     The DOM is the Document Object Model, which deals with the document, the HTML elements themselves, e.g. document and all traversal you would do in it,          events, etc.
     The BOM is the Browser Object Model, which deals with browser components aside from the document, like history, location, navigator and screen (as well as      some others that vary by browser).

2. What is event target property in javascript?
Ans: The target event property returns the element that triggered the event. The target property gets the element on which the event originally occurred,            opposed to the currentTarget property, which always refers to the element whose event listener triggered the event.

3. Update the previous example (WebPage5_Arrays_Dynamic.html)  to implement the following requirements:

	a. It does not allow to add duplicates. If you try to add it should show message. 
	b. If the given item is not exists, you need to show the message while removing the item. 
	
4.  Update the yesterday example (	all math operations -- assignment4) using single function for all operations.  Use target property to implement this. 	

5.  Create a web page to display products based on the selected category.

7.   What is difference between  indexOf()  and findIndex()
Ans: findIndex - Returns the index of the first element in the array where predicate is true, and -1 otherwise. indexOf - Returns the index of the first          occurrence of a value in an array.
